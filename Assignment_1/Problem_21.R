# Length Confirmation of a Complex Vector:
# After creating the complex vector described above, what function would you use to confirm its
# length is 25? What result from this function would indicate success?

# Using length() function will provide us with the length of the vector.After computing the length 
# of the vector, we use '==' operator to to check for length being equal to the required length 


Sol1 <- vector(mode = "complex" , length = 25L)
