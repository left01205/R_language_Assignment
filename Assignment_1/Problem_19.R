# Vector Repetition and Order Sorting:
# For the vector c(-2, 4, -6, 8, -10), describe how to repeat the vector itself three times 
# and each of its elements 5 times. Following this, how would you sort the resulting vector 
# from smallest to largest?


Vec1 <- c(-2, 4, -6, 8, -10)
S1 <- rep(x = Vec1 , times = 3 , each = 5)
print(S1)
